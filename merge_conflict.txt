1. To create a merge conflict i created two branches 'gitcomm1' and 'gitcomm2'
2. In gitcomm1 i put heading " Here are 'nine' git commands" and in gitcomm2 "Here are 'ten' git commands"
3. So while merging them it created a conflict for "nine" or "ten".
4. I resolved it by removing "nine" and keeping "ten"
5. Then committed the new changes in the main branch.
